# GEBERT: Graph-Enriched Biomedical Entity Representation Transformer

This repository presents source code for pretraining BERT-based biomedical entity representation models on UMLS synonyms and concept graphs. 


## Data

To train a model, you need to download a latest UMLS [release](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html). In the original GEBERT paper we utilized the 2020AB version.
